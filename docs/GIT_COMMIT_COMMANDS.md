# Git Commit Commands Documentation

**File:** `docs/GIT_COMMIT_COMMANDS.md`  
**Purpose:** Document the specific git commands used for committing changes and explain the reasoning behind each command  
**Audience:** Developers, AI assistants, and team members  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-30  

## Overview

This document records the exact git commands used to commit changes to the Fixed Ratio Trading Stress Test project, along with explanations of why each command was chosen and how it follows our established git commit standards.

## Commands Used for Recent Commit

### 1. Check Current Status
```bash
git status
```

**Why Used:**
- **Purpose:** Verify what files have been modified, added, or are untracked
- **Reasoning:** Essential first step to understand the scope of changes before committing
- **Output Analysis:** Shows modified files, new files, and staging status
- **Best Practice:** Always check status before staging to avoid unintended commits

**Expected Output:**
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   src/FixedRatioStressTest.Common/Models/PoolModels.cs
  modified:   src/FixedRatioStressTest.Core/Services/ThreadManager.cs

Untracked files:
  docs/FRT_EXPECTED_TOKENS_GUIDE.md
  src/FixedRatioStressTest.Common/Utils/
```

### 2. Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

**Why Used:**
- **Purpose:** Stage all modified and new files for commit
- **Reasoning:** 
  - `.` (dot) stages all changes in current directory and subdirectories
  - Includes both modified files and new untracked files
  - Ensures all related changes are committed together
- **Alternative:** Could use `git add <specific-files>` for selective staging
- **Best Practice:** Use `.` when changes are logically related and should be committed together

**Warning Messages:**
```
warning: in the working copy of 'src/FixedRatioStressTest.Common/Models/PoolModels.cs', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
```
- **Explanation:** Git is converting line endings from Unix (LF) to Windows (CRLF)
- **Impact:** Normal behavior on Windows systems, doesn't affect functionality

### 3. Commit with Detailed Message
```bash
git commit -m "fix: Resolve swap calculation mismatch causing 0x417 errors

- üîß Fixed: SwapCalculation.Calculate formulas were inverted for A‚ÜíB/B‚ÜíA swaps
- ‚úÖ Added: FRTExpectedTokens utility class with correct calculation logic
- üìä Enhanced: Comprehensive debugging logs for swap calculations
- üìù Created: FRT_EXPECTED_TOKENS_GUIDE.md with mathematical foundation
- üéØ Result: Swaps now succeed on first attempt with exact contract matching
- üîÑ Refactored: ThreadManager to use FRTExpectedTokens for validation
- üö® Critical: Resolved AMOUNT_MISMATCH (0x417) errors in swap operations"
```

**Why Used:**
- **Purpose:** Create a commit with a descriptive message following our standards
- **Reasoning:**
  - **Type Prefix:** `fix:` indicates this is a bug fix
  - **Subject Line:** Under 72 characters, describes the main issue
  - **Body:** Detailed bullet points explaining what was changed
  - **Emojis:** Used for visual clarity and quick scanning
  - **Specific Details:** References error codes (0x417) and technical specifics

**Commit Message Structure Analysis:**
```
fix: Resolve swap calculation mismatch causing 0x417 errors
```
- **Type:** `fix` (bug fix)
- **Subject:** Clear description of the problem solved
- **Length:** 58 characters (under 72 limit)

**Body Content:**
- **üîß Fixed:** What was broken and how it was fixed
- **‚úÖ Added:** New functionality added
- **üìä Enhanced:** Improvements made
- **üìù Created:** Documentation added
- **üéØ Result:** Impact of the changes
- **üîÑ Refactored:** Code restructuring
- **üö® Critical:** Importance level

### 4. Verify Commit
```bash
git log --oneline -1
```

**Why Used:**
- **Purpose:** Confirm the commit was created successfully
- **Reasoning:** 
  - `--oneline` shows abbreviated commit hash and subject line
  - `-1` shows only the most recent commit
  - Quick verification that commit was created with correct message

**Expected Output:**
```
bf205c1 (HEAD -> main) fix: Resolve swap calculation mismatch causing 0x417 errors
```

### 5. Show Commit Statistics
```bash
git show --stat | cat
```

**Why Used:**
- **Purpose:** Display detailed information about the commit
- **Reasoning:**
  - Shows commit hash, author, date, and full message
  - `--stat` displays file change statistics
  - Verifies all intended files were included
  - Shows insertions/deletions per file
  - **`| cat`** prevents pager usage and exits gracefully

**Pager Issue:**
- **Problem:** `git show` uses a pager (like `less`) by default
- **Symptom:** Command hangs waiting for user to press `q` to exit
- **Solution:** Pipe to `cat` to bypass pager and exit immediately
- **Alternative:** Use `git --no-pager show --stat` (Git 1.7.2+)

**Expected Output:**
```
commit bf205c16c1774340cbc291e020bd69b34ecebf81 (HEAD -> main)
Author: DJ <davincij@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Aug 30 10:19:03 2025 +0400

## Alternative Commands Considered

### Selective Staging
```bash
git add src/FixedRatioStressTest.Common/Models/PoolModels.cs
git add src/FixedRatioStressTest.Core/Services/ThreadManager.cs
git add docs/FRT_EXPECTED_TOKENS_GUIDE.md
git add src/FixedRatioStressTest.Common/Utils/FRTExpectedTokens.cs
```

**Why Not Used:**
- More verbose and error-prone
- All changes were logically related (fixing the same issue)
- `git add .` is more efficient for related changes

### Interactive Staging
```bash
git add -i
```

**Why Not Used:**
- Overkill for this simple case
- All changes needed to be committed together
- Standard staging was sufficient

### Commit with Editor
```bash
git commit
```

**Why Not Used:**
- `-m` flag allows direct message input
- Message was already prepared following standards
- Avoids potential editor configuration issues

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Check Before Committing
- Always run `git status` first
- Understand what will be committed
- Avoid unintended changes

### 2. Use Descriptive Messages
- Follow established commit message format
- Include type prefix (`fix:`, `feat:`, etc.)
- Provide detailed body with bullet points
- Use emojis for visual clarity

### 3. Verify After Committing
- Check commit was created correctly
- Verify all intended files were included
- Review commit statistics

### 4. Group Related Changes
- Commit related changes together
- Use logical grouping for staging
- Avoid committing unrelated changes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This:
```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "bug fix"
```

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:
```bash
git commit -m "fix: Resolve swap calculation mismatch causing 0x417 errors

- üîß Fixed: Specific issue description
- ‚úÖ Added: New functionality
- üìä Enhanced: Improvements made"
```

## Summary

The git commands used for this commit followed a systematic approach:

1. **Verify** - Check what needs to be committed
