- ✅ **All Core Endpoints**: 
  - Pool management (create, list, get)
  - Thread management (create, start, stop, delete, empty)
  - Monitoring (status, statistics)
  - Token operations (mint_and_send_tokens)

### 7. **Error Handling**
- ✅ **Graceful Recovery**: Threads continue after expected errors
- ✅ **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking per thread
- ✅ **State Preservation**: Thread state saved on errors
- ✅ **Contract Error Handling**: Proper handling of on-chain errors

### 8. **State Persistence**
- ✅ **JSON Storage**: Complete implementation
- ✅ **Thread State**: Configuration and statistics saved

## 💡 **Key Achievements**

Despite the missing advanced features, the implementation successfully achieves the core goal of stress testing:

1. **✅ Concurrent Operations**: Multiple threads operating simultaneously
2. **✅ Realistic Load**: Random amounts and timing create unpredictable patterns
3. **✅ Edge Case Discovery**: Token sharing creates complex scenarios
4. **✅ Resource Management**: Automatic funding prevents thread starvation
5. **✅ Error Resilience**: Threads continue despite failures
6. **✅ Network Accessible**: Remote management via JSON-RPC

The service is **production-ready for stress testing** with the current implementation, though performance optimizations would enhance throughput for extreme load testing scenarios.
